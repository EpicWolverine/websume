			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://survivor.epicwolverine.com">EpicWolverine's Survivor</a> - a custom NFL survivor pool for my friends and I. We wanted to set rules that existing services didn't support, so I made my own based on <a href="https://github.com/CollegeFootballRisk/cfbr_orders">a previous collaboration</a>. I used this to learn more about Python web hosting with Flask and database interfacing with SQLite3.</li>
				<li><a href="http://heardle.epicwolverine.com">EpicWolverine's Heardle</a> - a modified reimplementation of Heardle with songs chosen by a friend and I. I learned enough React to modify an existing project with bug fixes and new features. <a aria-label="View EpicWolverine/PersonalHeardle on GitHub" href="https://github.com/EpicWolverine/PersonalHeardle" class="github-button">View on GitHub</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://parrot.epicwolverine.com">Parrot Soundboard</a> - a website full of funny situational sound bites. This is a more complex AngularJS app with all the funny quotes that made my friends and I laugh in high school and college. <a aria-label="View EpicWolverine/ParrotSoundboard on GitHub" href="https://github.com/EpicWolverine/ParrotSoundboard" class="github-button">View on GitHub</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://earthgallery.epicwolverine.com">The World Is Just Awesome</a> - a viewer for some of the most stunning photos in Earth. This was created as a tech demo while learning AngularJS. <a aria-label="View EpicWolverine/TheWorldIsJustAwesome on GitHub" href="https://github.com/EpicWolverine/TheWorldIsJustAwesome" class="github-button">View on GitHub</a></li>
